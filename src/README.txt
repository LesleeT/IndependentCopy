Instructions for IndependentCopy Project:
===========================================

Note that there are 5 Git branches demonstrating different versions of
this project. The "master" branch is the basic DIP sample.

The branches named 'factory1', 'factory2', 'factory3' and 'factory4' show various
implementations of the factory pattern to decouple the readers and writers
from the client classes (in this case the client class is the 'Driver'.

IMPORTANT: Before trying to switch to a different branch, make sure you first
save any changes, then perform a Git 'Add' followed by a Git 'Commit'. 
Also, do not open branches starting with the word 'origin', such as
'origin/factory1'. These are the remote branches on GitHub and should
NEVER be opened. Only open local branches, such as 'factory1'.
